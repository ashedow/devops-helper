## The 4Vs of Big Data
It is a complete misconception. Volume is only one part of the often called four V’s of
big data: **Volume**, **velocity**, **variety** and **veracity**.

**Volume** is about the size. How much data you have.

**Velocity** is about the speed of how fast the data is getting to you. How much data is in a specific time needs to get processed or is coming into the system. This is where the whole concept of streaming data and real-time processing comes in to
play.

**Variety** is the third one. It means, that the data is very different. That you have very
different types of data structures. Like CSV files, PDFs that you have stuff in XML. That you have JSON logfiles, or that you have data in some kind of a key value store. It’s about the variety of data types from different sources that you basically want to join together. All to make an analysis based on that data. 

**Veracity** is fourth and this is a very very difficult one. The issue with big data is, that
it is very unreliable. You cannot really trust the data. Especially when you’re coming from the IoT, the Internet of Things side. Devices use sensors for measurement of temperature, pressure,
acceleration and so on.
