# Hash table

A hash table is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

Hash tables offer a combination of efficient lookup, insert and delete operations. 
8 * a lookup in an unsorted array takes linear worst-case time;
in a sorted array, a lookup using binary search is very fast, but insertions become inefficient;
* in a linked list an insertion can be efficient, but lookups take linear time.
